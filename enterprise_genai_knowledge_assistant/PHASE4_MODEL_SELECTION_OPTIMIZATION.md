# Phase 4: Model Selection and Optimization - Complete Implementation

## ✅ **All Phase 4 Features Implemented**

---

## 1️⃣ **Query Complexity Analysis** ✅

### **Enhanced Scoring System (0-100 points)**

```python
def analyze_query_complexity(query, conversation_history):
    """
    Multi-factor complexity analysis with weighted scoring
    """
    complexity_score = 0
    factors = []
    
    # 5 Analysis Factors:
    1. Query Length (0-20 points)
    2. Conversation Depth (0-15 points)
    3. Complex Indicators (0-25 points)
    4. Technical Terminology (0-20 points)
    5. Question Type (0-20 points)
    
    return complexity_score, factors
```
